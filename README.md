# Web Calculator

This is a simple web calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.
It has been made for my Web Engineering course at the Universidad de Antioquia.

- Clear and intuitive user interface, made using mobile first methodology.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes (made for smartphones also).
